# Data Structures & Algorithms in C (and Python)

Welcome to my repo where I showcase my understanding of various data structures and algorithms through implementations in C, and sometimes Python. This project is a learning journey and a personal reference guide, complete with a roadmap of tasks that I'll update as I progress.

## Repository Overview

This repo is organized to help me track progress on different data structures and algorithms implementations. The main sections include:

- **Source Code:** Implementations in C and Python.
- **Documentation:** Explanations, usage examples, and learning notes.
- **TODO List:** A guide to what I plan to implement next.


## TODO List

### 1. Data Structures
- [ ] **Linked Lists:**
    - [x] Singly lists( C & python)
    - [ ] doubly lists
- [ ] **Hash Tables:** Collision handling and optimization.
- [ ] **Stacks & Queues:** Implementation and applications.
- [ ] **Trees:**
  - [ ] Binary Trees
  - [ ] Binary Search Trees (BST)
  - [ ] AVL Trees / Self-balancing Trees
- [ ] **Graphs:**
  - [ ] Representations (adjacency list, matrix)
  - [ ] Traversals (DFS, BFS)
- [ ] **Heaps & Priority Queues:** Building and using heaps.
- [ ] **Tries:** Basic implementation and use-cases.

### 2. Algorithms
- [ ] **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - [ ] Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
  - [ ] Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- [ ] **Searching Algorithms:**
  - [ ] Linear Search, Binary Search
  - [ ] Graph search algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- [ ] **Recursion & Backtracking:** Problems like permutations and combinations.
- [ ] **Dynamic Programming:** Fibonacci, Knapsack, and other DP problems.
- [ ] **Greedy Algorithms:** Activity selection and more.
- [ ] **Graph Algorithms:**
  - [ ] Dijkstra's, A* for pathfinding
- [ ] **String Algorithms:** Pattern searching (KMP, Rabin-Karp, etc.)
